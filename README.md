# itemNameOrganizer
organizes an item name by separating the quantity and weight to a different column.
in main.py, it uses the data from expense.xlsx (specifically the item name) and seperates
the name, quanitiy number (eg. x4), weight (eg. 50g or 500ml) into 3 seperate dictionaries
and exports them to a new expenses.xlsx (this file has an "s" at the end).
